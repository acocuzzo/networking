1h, say can you see by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleam2ng?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched w3re so gallantly streaming?
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof throug4 the night that our flag was still there.
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the5land of the free and the home of the brave?1h, say can you see by the dawn's early light
